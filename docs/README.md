# RR SYSTEM v1 — CANONICAL HANDOFF (MULTI-ZIP)

This folder set is the authoritative snapshot of the RR System v1 as designed.

Core Laws (locked):
- Specs → Geometry → AI
- Instrumental specs define geometry (AI cannot edit)
- Generations are immutable
- AI actions are explicit and audited
- Exports are clean and role-scoped

This handoff is split across multiple ZIPs to avoid tooling limits.
